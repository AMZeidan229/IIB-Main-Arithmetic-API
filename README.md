# IIB Main Arithmetic API - MegaSoft Project

This repository contains the Arithmetic API for the MegaSoft project. The API provides a variety of arithmetic operations and is designed to integrate seamlessly with the larger MegaSoft infrastructure.

## Objectives & Goals
The main goal is to develop an API that can efficiently process arithmetic operations. Additionally, the project will focus on implementing a microservices architecture to enhance scalability and maintainability.


## Features
The Arithmetic API offers:
- Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Support for both integer and floating-point operations.
- RESTful design for easy integration.
- Error handling and input validation to ensure correct results.
- Scalable and modular structure to accommodate further arithmetic extensions.
